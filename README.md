## Wire Framing

Before writing the code to build your websites and make them responsive it is a good idea to have a visual idea of what you are going build!

The subject for this assignment will be the React Fundamentals tutorial. 

Your goal is to draw two wire frames one for the desktop version and one for a mobile version. 

Follow this guide on wire framing: https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/

### User stories

1. As a user, I can visit the site to search for the nearest space by clicking a map view.
2. As a user, I can visit the site on my phone and still get all the information as if I was on the desktop site.
3. As a user, I can check the times a space is open until by viewing a space's detailed view.
